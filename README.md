# Sorting-Algorithms-in-C--School Work

Used selection sort algorithm to sort the elements of an array in descending order
Made used of some color patterns to show the current element checked 
and index of the element being swapped

Simple selection sort algorithm: begins by checking the greatest element within an array and move it to 
its intended position and keeps doing this with the rest of the array till the array is sorted

Simple linear sort algorithm takes each element from the first position to the last comparing 
and swapping if they are less than the previous till sorting is complete

NOTE: the textcolor function may vary from editor to editor
